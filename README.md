# MysticalSurvival-Modpack
  Welcome to a "Mystical" Modpack. By using Botania and many other mods you (might) survive on a deserted skyblock island. 
With the power of living root and your bare hand(s) you can harvest stone and make some saplings.
By using these saplings you are able to create sieves, many other resources from nothing, and your imagination, you can create your own kingdom from the ground up.
